According to the Semantic UI website, the goal of the framework is to empower designers and developers “by creating a language for sharing UI”. They do this by leveraging a semantic, descriptive language for its classes and naming conventions. Instead of using abbreviations, as other frameworks do, it utilizes real words in a manner closer to plain English.
Another thing that I noticed is the package, very well organized, every component if you want has its own stylesheet and script-file, therefore you'll be able to load only what you need, even because the package is quite heavy if you include everything in a single page.

For a pre-release I admit that I'm considering to build my next web-app with such framework, but I got some perplexities:

    is that mobile-first like Bootstrap or Foundation? from what I'm able to see, it doesn't look so;
    Bootstrap has two valid and well-known contributors and Foundation got Zurb behind, what about SemanticUI? this is a pre-release, are we gonna see other releases?

because of such perplexities I think to avoid to use it for a business/commercial project at the moment, maybe in a very near future, but if you're planning to use it for your own personal web-app (like mine), I think it's a pretty good choice.

Then if you wanna fallback to Bootstrap for any reason, I think it's not that painful (many of Semantic components seem based on Bootstrap).

The learning curve is small, except may be, the grid system.
I realized that Bootstrap doesn't dictate you how to use it. You can throw a class here, and another there, and still get job done.

The first time I used Semantic UI, I was working on a web app: hoo.gy (disclaimer: I am the owner). I came to conclusion that You have to learn a lot of stuff to get started. In some cases, the widgets I needed required Semantic UI JavaScript to be loaded. This didn't give me flexibility I wanted. It is rich on ready to use widgets. It gets complex tasks done, if you have time to explore what It has to offer.

Bottom line, the choice is going to depend on your project. If you want a full fledged, tightly-coupled framework Semantic UI may be a good choice. If you want minimum to achieve better results, then go with Bootstrap.
