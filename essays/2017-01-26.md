  Be on-topic

The community is defined by a specific set of topics in the help center;  stick to those topics and avoid asking for opinions or open-ended discussion. If your question is about the site itself, ask on our meta-discussion site. If you’re looking for a different topic, it might be covered on another Stack Exchange site.
Be specific

If you ask a vague question, you’ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful, relevant answer.
Make it relevant to others

 Make it clear how your question is relevant to more people than just you, and more of us will be interested in your question and willing to look into it.
Keep an open mind

The answer to your question may not always be the one you wanted, but that doesn’t mean it is wrong. A conclusive answer isn’t always possible. When in doubt, ask people to cite their sources, or to explain how/where they learned something. Even if we don’t agree with you, or tell you exactly what you wanted to hear, remember: we’re just trying to help.

   Context

In most cases, anyone answering the question will need to know what language and platform you’re using. The basics should usually be communicated through tags, but it may very well be worth providing more information:
    Language version (e.g. C# 4)
    Platform version (e.g. .NET 3.5; note that this isn’t always implicit from the language version, or vice versa)
    Operating system, if it could be relevant (e.g. particular permissions issues)
    Any other relevant software (e.g. database type and version, the IDE you’re using, web server you’re connecting to)
    Any other constraints. This is particularly important. It’s really annoying to give a perfectly good answer to a question, only to be told that you’re not allowed to use feature X or Y which provide the obvious solution.
        If you have unusual constraints, it’s worth explaining why. Not only does this answer the obvious follow-up comment, but it also gives more information about what other solutions may not be applicable.
